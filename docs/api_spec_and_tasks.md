## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("parser.py", "Contains the Parser class which is responsible for parsing the 10K filings. It should be implemented first as it is a dependency for the Main class."),
    ("wacc.py", "Contains the WACC class which is responsible for calculating the WACC. It should be implemented after the Parser class as it depends on the data parsed by the Parser."),
    ("exceptions.py", "Contains custom exceptions for error handling. It can be implemented at any time as it does not have any dependencies."),
    ("main.py", "Contains the Main class which is the entry point of the program. It uses the Parser and WACC classes, so it should be implemented last.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "parser.py",
    "wacc.py",
    "exceptions.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'parser.py' contains the Parser class which is responsible for parsing the 10K filings. It uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML of the filings.

'wacc.py' contains the WACC class which is responsible for calculating the WACC. It uses the formula: WACC = (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd * (1 - Tc).

'exceptions.py' contains custom exceptions for error handling.

'main.py' contains the Main class which is the entry point of the program. It uses the argparse library to handle command-line arguments and the cProfile module to optimize the program for efficiency.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me. However, we need to ensure that the team is familiar with the BeautifulSoup library and the formula for calculating WACC. Additionally, we need to ensure that the team understands how to use the argparse library and the cProfile module.
